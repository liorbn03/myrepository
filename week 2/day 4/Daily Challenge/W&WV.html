We spend our lives dreaming of happiness, searching for happiness, and trying to buy happiness. But like the colt chasing the carrot on a stick, happiness always eludes us, because it’s in the future. The only way to find happiness is to understand that happiness is not a goal. Happiness is a by-product of living the right kind of life, of having an internal sense of peace. You don’t get to happiness by pursuing it. You get to happiness by living a life that means something."</p>

                            <p>Wild vegetables are a great way to add variety and nutrition to your diet. Unlike cultivated vegetables, they are often richer in flavor and nutrients. Many wild vegetables are also packed with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, making them an excellent choice for supporting overall health. Some popular examples include dandelion greens, stinging nettles, and purslane. So next time you're out on a hike or foraging for food, keep an eye out for these nutrient-rich wild vegetables!</p>
